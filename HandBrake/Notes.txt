Debian Jessie only has HandbrakeCLI v0.9.9, which doesn't have the
--non-anamorphic flag support.
This technique didn't work for newer versions using Debian Sid pkg's.

So downloaded a Handbrake QPKG, and extracted the components from that instead.

==============================================================================

Download & Install Entware-NG opkg

/opt/bin/opkg update
/opt/bin/opkg install tar
/opt/bin/opkg install ar

Use a temporary location to extract packages, the move /opt/bin & /opt/lib
etc.

Download Debian Jessie Handbrake-cli & dependency packages (see below)

	ar xv <deb-package>
	tar xvf data.tar.xv

will extract package contents.

Either copy entire package or select the dependency and copy to lib directory.

See required-pkgs.txt & required-libs.txt
